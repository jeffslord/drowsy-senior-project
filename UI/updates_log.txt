- Get the app to send a name to the server and have the server send something back (either new or existing ID) to enter into the gray table cell
- Get the headset sending data to the app and get the app to send that data to the server
- Get app to play training alerts (close/open eyes) while collecting AND sending data for specified time limit (for profile training)
